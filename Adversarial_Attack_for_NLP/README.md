## Code Demo

In this repo, we included the following demo codes:

### Augmentations.ipynb
Jupyter notebook shows how to Augmenting a dataset using TextAttack.

### End_to_End.ipynb: 
Jupyter notebook contains the tutorial for a broad end-to-end overview of training, evaluating, and attacking a model using TextAttack.

### Example_tensorflow.ipynb:
Jupyter notebook contains a demo for implementing the TextAttack on a text classification model using TensorFlow. It contains two parts: training and attacking.

### Introduction_and_Transformations(BananaWordSwap).ipynb
Jupyter notebook contains a basic introduction for TextAttack and a simple example of using transformations to create adversarial attack.

### TextAttack Demo.ipynb
Jupyter notebook contains basic installation for TextAttack and how to use command line to utilize TextAttack for attacking, training and evaluation. 

### models
A folder contains the pre-trained models that TextAttack includes.
