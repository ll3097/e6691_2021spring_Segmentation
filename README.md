# e6691.2021Spring.PaperReviewsRepo_shared

This repo is used as a common space related to student paper presentations/code on various topics.
The students have edit privileges, and they can (and should) add directories, subdirectories, code, README, etc.

Since this is only a single repo, students may wish to have some other private repo which has been forked from yet another public github - that would allow them to have "a full dedicated repo for their paper presentation". In that case: (i) they must share access to that github to the class, as well as administrative privieleges to the professor (use columbia email for invites); (ii) They still need to create a directory in this repo, within which (inside the README file) they need to add the link to that special full repo; the README should have some basic description of the paper that they are working on, link to their google slides etc.

This repo is organized in directories and subdirectories, as suitable for the course for this semester.
An example of a potential directory organization, from 2020 Spring:

** ObjectDetection_topic1

** ObjectDetection_topic2

** GANs

** FeatureVisualization

** BatchNormalization

** ...
