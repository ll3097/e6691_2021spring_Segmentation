# ObjectDetection_topic3 Repository

This directory contains example code for the the R-CNN family of object detection & segmentation models. 

## Detectron2:
Pytorch framework implemented by the Facebook's AI Research team. It contains implementations of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including variants of Mask R-CNN:

### Detectron2_Tutorial.ipynb: 
Jupyter notebook by the authors of Detectron2 at Facebook. This tutorial illustrates example usage of detectron 2 including inference from pretrained models and training a new model on a custom dataset.
